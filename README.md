## 🔐 Project Description

This project is a robust and user-friendly *File Encryption and Decryption Tool* developed in Python, using the *AES-256 encryption standard* through the cryptography library. AES-256 is one of the most secure symmetric encryption algorithms available and is widely trusted for securing sensitive data in both personal and enterprise environments.

The application allows users to:
- 🔐 *Encrypt any file* (text, documents, images, PDFs, etc.)
- 🔓 *Decrypt encrypted files* using a securely generated and stored key
- 🔑 *Generate a unique secret key* for encryption/decryption purposes

It is especially useful for:
- Students learning about encryption and file handling
- Developers who need a simple but strong local encryption tool
- Anyone looking to protect confidential data on their system

### 💡 How It Works:
- A *secret key* is generated using Python's cryptography.fernet module.
- This key is saved as a secret.key file.
- Files are encrypted using this key and saved with a .enc extension.
- To decrypt, the same key is used to revert the file back to its original form.

This tool supports *any file type*, works entirely on your local machine, and has a clean command-line interface for ease of use.

### ✨ Key Benefits:
- No external services or cloud dependency — 100% offline
- Strong, military-grade AES-256 encryption
- Simple menu-driven interface, easy for beginners
- Lightweight, fast, and easily customizable for advanced users

> ⚠ Note: It uses symmetric encryption, which means the *same key*
